# How to run:

1. First install Spring Boot. I believe you can install it by first installing Java and then installing Spring Tools or you can follow the
instructions to here https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started.installing.


2. Install ReactJS


3. Install PostGres

You can configure the database in the application properties. Currently, the database is set up in a schema called 'blog', which is required for creating the application. You can create the schema using DBeaver or manually. Once everything is installed, navigate to the folder and run 'build.sh' to build the frontend ReactJS and backend Java components and launch the site.
