# How to run:

1. First install Spring Boot. I believe you can install it by first installing Java and then installing Spring Tools or you can follow the
instructions to here https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started.installing.


2. Install ReactJS


3. Install PostGres


You can configure the database in application properties. I currently have the database in a schema called blog, which is required for you
create. You can create a schema with DBeaver or manually. 
After everything is installed you can go in the folder and run build.sh. This will build the frontend Reactjs and the backend Java and then run the site.
